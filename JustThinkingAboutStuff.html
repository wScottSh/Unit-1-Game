<!--
each player use two keys to move sprite up and down.

the objective is to have the ball bounce off of sprite and launch it to opposing player
look at js racer for the player movements and find out how to apply that movement vertically, instead of horizontally.

create score board that logs every time a player misses. if plater one misses, player two gets a point.
give players three chances to miss. eg: if player one misses three times, alert that player two wins.

Huge focus made on the ball's animation trajectory.
when ball hits a paddle, launch a random angle away from padd;e that hit it. repeat process when second player hits bapl with paddle.

 reminder to me: I know design is super tempting, but don't you dare get wrapped up in that before the game is functional. DON'T YOU DARE.

 watching the third video of the canvas tutorial, bounce off of the side of the screen is mentioned at the 5-sh minute mark.

 invoke ball animation with a click event. choose math.random direction to start. when ball hits....
 if ball hit is equal to "name of sprite ID", then bounce back at random.

 else, opposing player scores a point
