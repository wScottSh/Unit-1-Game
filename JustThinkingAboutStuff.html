event listeners!!!! same as with js racer but keydown will move up and down instead of horizontally... -  and + indicate vertical mvmt. eg: -10 would move ten pixels up and +10 moves 10 px down.


handling the paddles

function movePAddle  () {
  document.addEventListener('keypress', (event) => {
    if (event.key === 'q') {
      player1 = player1 + 15;  this makes it move right. trying to find exactly how to make it move up

      i think it would be player1 -= 15;

handling the ball
not sure stylesheet

handling the scoreboard

....if statement


make players out of divs? and ball is canvas

i think i am going insane
