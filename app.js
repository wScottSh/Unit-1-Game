// I know you guys recommended I don't take on a project using canvas because it would be an entirely new thing to learn, but I wanted to
   //take on the challenge and really test myself. And since I dont really celebrate Christmas, I had nothing stopping me, as far as time restrictions. I hope that's ok. Below
   //are the resources I used to learn canvas technique.
//

//Ok! here's my stuff. code will be written below the comment that explains its purpose. Some of the comments may be overly verbose, but I wanted to show you guys that I know the
