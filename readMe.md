Essentially, I will be creating my own version of Pong. The initial map would have two paddles, one on the left, one on the right. They would be placed on a game board with a center line and feature a ball that the two paddles would be able to hit back and forth.  
Essentially, the original Pong, But with my own personalized theme: Freddy vs. Jason.


player 1-be Freddy beating Jason to see a screenshot of elm st movie

Be Jason-beating Freddy to generate a screenshot of Friday movie

Objective of players to is beat each other in a “Freddy vs. Jason” tennis match.

this game is a version of pong that will feature original 8 bit art/ sprites created by me.

OR!! plan B :
That game where the ball falls from the ceiling and the paddle will 'catch it.'
In that case, the theme will be Jaws. Jaws as the paddle and tiny swimmer falling into his mouth as the 'catch'
