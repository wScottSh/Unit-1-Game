#Description:

A single player, pong-like game with a paddle placed at the bottom of the screen, and a ball that falls from the top. This will be aesthetically styled in an 8-bit, retro game fashion.
My stretch goal will be to make a two-player replica of Pong, also in 8-bit style. Either will be including 8-bit sprites I create, hopefully.
First and foremost, I want to get functionality working. Design will come second.
