Description:

A single player, pong-like game This will be aesthetically styled in an 8-bit, retro game fashion.
My stretch goal will be to make a two-player replica of Pong, also in 8-bit style. I will be including 8-bit sprites I create, hopefully.
First and foremost, I want to get functionality working. Design will come second.
