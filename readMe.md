Description:

A single player, pong-like game with a paddle placed at the bottom of the screen, and a ball that falls from the top. This will be aesthetically styled in an 8-bit, retro game fashion. The theme will be
Jaws. Jaws as the paddle and tiny swimmer falling into his mouth as the 'catch'.
My stretch goal will be to make a two-player replica of Pong, also in 8-bit style, with the theme of Freddy vs. Jason. Either will be including 8-bit sprites I create.
First and foremost, I want to get functionality working. Elaborate design will come second.
